# machine learning with django (Parkinson's diagnosis)
Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide, early and accurate diagnosis is very important for effective treatment, which can be easily done using machine learning in Python.
In this project, using the Django framework and on the web platform, I created a model(SVM) to diagnose Parkinson's disease as well as possible.
